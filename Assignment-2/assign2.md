## On Analysis of Time Complexity:<br>

### __1.Find the sum of two numbers a and b__

__Pseudocode__:
```c
add(a,b)
{
  return a+b //Takes 2 units of time; one for arithmetic operation and another for returning the added value
}
```
Note: The above lines are just pseudo code, they do not run in IDE<br>

Time complexity = 2 units = constant = O(1)<br>

__Observation:__<br> 
* 1 unit time for arithmetic operation<br> 
* 1 unit time for return statement.
