![Compiled program results in C](compiled-program.png)

These are the compilation results of the sum of series program in Linux based O.S i.e. Ubuntu with the following comm
So, we can say that actual time required to execute code is machine dependent.
Hence, Instead of measuring actual time required in executing each statement in the code, we consider how many times each statement execute.
