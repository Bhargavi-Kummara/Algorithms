## Observation report:
__Time Complexity of algorithm/code is not equal to the actual time required to execute a particular code but the number of times a statement executes.__<br>
Because when I compiled the sum of series program in Linux based O.S i.e. Ubuntu with the following commands
	
> gcc file.c â€“ o file

> time ./file

So, we can say that actual time required to execute code is machine dependent.
Hence, Instead of measuring actual time required in executing each statement in the code, we consider how many times each statement execute.
